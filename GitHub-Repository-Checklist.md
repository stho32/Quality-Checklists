# GitHub Repository Checklist

  - [ ] You have a readme.md in the base directory telling the most important stuff.
  - [ ] You have a directory "Documentation"
    - [ ] The directory at least contains a file "Requirements.md" which contains a checklist of all the tasks to accomplish.
  - [ ] You have a directory "Source" which contains the source code. 
  - [ ] If the content of the repository has browsable parts, then github pages is enabled and points to it.
  - [ ] The base directory is mostly just a place to place your README.md and some folders. You may add some shell scripts of bigger importance. 
  - [ ] You have examples of configuration files around.
  - [ ] You do _not_ have real configuration files placed within the repository, and of course you have never a real working password in your github repo. 
  - [ ] If possible, add build status and additional logos that inform about the health of the project, test coverage, ... whatever.
